final_output.csv contains the forecasted WSI for the visualization. 

There are 9 possible combinations of the input parameters. 

GDP = (-2%, 0%, 2%)
Total Population = (-2%, 0%, 2%)

These parameters will add on to the individual country's growth rate. For instance, if Peru's GDP growth rate is 3.9% and the user selected -2%, then the growth rate will be calculated at 1.9%. 

0% is the default and what was scraped from wikipedia.
